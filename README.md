# basic-html

Basic html is an exercise is used to demonstrate my knowledge of git working with workflows 
as well as a chance to show my html/css skills in designing a webpage that has a header, main content area and sidebar. 

The webpage will be coded without any UI library/framework. 
It will have a user friendly UI that works well in modern browsers.

The main content will display content sections for an About Me, Work Experience, Education, Skills and Section of my Work 
The Sidebar will have a search bar, Navigation bar and Contact detials
